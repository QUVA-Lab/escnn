CONTRIBUTING
------------

First of all, if you are reading this page, it means you would like to contribute to our library.
We are very happy to welcome you among the contributors of **escnn**! :D 

To contribute to **escnn**, you can just open an *issue* (and I will try to solve it as soon as I can) or you can create
a *pull-request* proposing your own solution or some new feature.
If you want to open a *pull-request*, please read the section below about DCO.


### DCO requirements for Pull-Requests.

When you create a *pull-request*, you need to agree to the [license](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn/blob/master/LICENSE) 
of our library and certify that you wrote the code (or have the rights to contribute with that code).
This is the **Developer Certificate of Origin** (DCO), which is described in more details [here](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/).
Please, read that page before opening a pull-request.

In practice, this means you need to *sign-off* all your commits by adding the following line to the commit messages:
```
Your commit message.

Signed-off-by: Your Name And Surname <your@email.com>
```

Git also has a `-s` option to automatically add this line in you commits.
Again, check [this page](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) for more details.


Note also that, when you create a pull-request, Github automatically *checks* if all your commits are signed, so you can
check if some commit misses the signature directly in the pull-request page.
